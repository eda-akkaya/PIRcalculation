# PIRcalculation
**PIR:** _https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_Index_Rating_
This is one of my hobby projects.  
According to the entered statistics, the player's efficiency score(PIR) is calculated.  
Different calculations are made depending on the league the player plays in. (Euroleague or NBA)  
An interface design that is easy for the user should be made.
Use java.
